###### The Algorithm

Just scan the Maze, and fill in each dead end, filling in the
passage backwards from the block until you reach a junction. This
includes filling in passages that become parts of dead ends once
other dead ends are removed. At the end only the solution will
remain, or solutions if there are more than one.

What is left is a maze with only solution tiles. Loop through
these cells and build the solution(s).

###### Notes

This is a simple Maze solving algorithm.
It focuses on the Maze, is always very fast, and uses no extra
memory.

This will always find the one unique solution for perfect Mazes,
but won't do much in heavily braid Mazes, and in fact won't do
anything useful at all for those Mazes without dead ends.

## Wall Follower

###### The Algorithm

Ideally:

0. Follow the right wall and you will eventually end up at the end.

In reality:

1. Choose a random starting direction.
2. At each intersection, take the rightmost turn. At dead-ends, turn around.
3. If you have gone more than (H * W) + 2 cells, stop; the maze will not be solved.
4. Terminate when you reach the end cell.
5. Prune the extraneous branches from the solution before returning it.

###### Notes

To the human brain, this is the easiest possible way to solve a maze. Drunk college kids use this algorithm to solve corn mazes every year. But if we go purely by the number of lines of code, this is one of the hardest maze-solving algorithms to implement on a computer. Neat.

It should be noted that this algorithm does not solve mazes that are not perfect.


## Vocabulary

1. __biased__ - a maze is biased if there are long runs and corridors more in the North/South or East/West directions.
2. __cell__ - an open passage in the maze
3. __grid__ - the grid is the combination of all passages and barriers in the maze
4. __perfect__ - a maze is perfect if it has one and only one solution
5. __sparse__ - a sparse maze has walls or passages thicker than the usual single unit width
6. __wall__ - an impassable barrier in the maze
