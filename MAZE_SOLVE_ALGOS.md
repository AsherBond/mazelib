###### The Algorithm

Ideally:

0. Follow the right wall and you will eventually end up at the end.

In reality:

1. Choose a random starting direction.
2. At each intersection, take the rightmost turn. At dead-ends, turn around.
3. If you have gone more than (H * W) + 2 cells, stop; the maze will not be solved.
4. Terminate when you reach the end cell.
5. Prune the extraneous branches from the solution before returning it.

###### Notes

To the human brain, this is the easiest possible way to solve a maze. Drunk college kids use this algorithm to solve corn mazes every year. But if we go purely by the number of lines of code, this is one of the hardest maze-solving algorithms to implement on a computer. Neat.

It should be noted that this algorithm does not solve mazes that are not perfect.
