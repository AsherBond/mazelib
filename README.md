# mazelib

#### A Python API for creating and solving mazes.  --  WORK IN PROGRESS

## [The mazelib API](docs/API.md)

A quick introduction in how to use this library.


## [Examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md)

Examples of different ways to display mazes. And some examples of how to create more unique, tailored mazes.


## [Maze-Generating Algorithms](docs/MAZE_GEN_ALGOS.md)

## [Maze-Solving Algorithms](docs/MAZE_SOLVE_ALGOS.md)

The heart of this library is the huge collection of algorithms available to create and solve mazes. The better you understand these, the more you can do with this library.
