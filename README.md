# mazelib

#### A Python API for creating and solving mazes.  --  WORK IN PROGRESS

## The mazelib API

A quick introduction to how to use this library.

#### [The mazelib API](docs/API.md)


## Examples

Many examples of different ways to display mazes. And lots of examples of how to create more unique, creative mazes.

#### [Examples of Using mazelib](docs/EXAMPLES.md)


## The Algorithms

The heart of this library is the huge collection of algorithms available to create and solve mazes. The better you understand these, the more you can do with this library.
