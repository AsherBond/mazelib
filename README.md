# mazelib

#### A Python API for creating and solving mazes.  --  WORK IN PROGRESS

## The mazelib API

A quick introduction to how to use this library.

#### [The mazelib API](docs/API.md)


## Examples

Many examples of different ways to display mazes. And lots of examples of how to create more unique, creative mazes.

#### [Examples of Using mazelib](docs/EXAMPLES.md)


## The Algorithms

There are many algorithms for generating and solving mazes. This library covers all the major ones, and then some. And most of these implementations have optional parameters to provide more flexibility.
